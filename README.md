# bpmlabs-services

Some basic services to be used for implementing business processes in the BPM labs.

Install using curl:

    curl -L https://raw.github.com/jojow/bpmlabs-services/master/install.sh | bash

Or using wget:

    wget -qO- https://raw.github.com/jojow/bpmlabs-services/master/install.sh | bash

By default, everything gets installed to $HOME/bpmlabs-services, so you can run it from there:

    cd $HOME/bpmlabs-services
    ./run.sh
